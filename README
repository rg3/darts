This program solves possible ways to check out a given score when playing a
game of darts in the typical 301, 501 or other typical variants, using the
traditional requirement that the last dart must land in a double-value
dartboard segment or in the bullseye.

It's implemented in C++. Building the program requires a compiler for C++11 (or
a later version) and GNU Make. Other make tools may also work and the program
can also be built by hand or using an IDE.

The compiled program prints usage instructions when called without arguments.

The code is released to the public domain under the terms of the CC0 license.
